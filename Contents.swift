//var str = "Hello, playground"
//Start with these variables:

var a = 12
var b = 65
var c = 31
var d = 98
//Write code to find the average of these four numbers.
//A-D Added Together
print (a + b + c + d)
//A-D Average
print ((a + b + c + d) / 4)

//Find the average yourself using paper or a calculator. Is your answer different than you found with Swift? Why?
51.5
//because it rounds to an integer
//Say you have the operation a + b * c / d. What result do you get out from Swift? What other outputs can you get out by adding one or more pairs of parentheses to the equation?
print ((a + b) * (c/d))


5<3 // false
12>7 // true
6 !=8 // true
7 == "7" // false
